            <h1>Process Scheduling</h1>
            <p>Process scheduling is a key concept in operating systems, responsible for determining which process runs at 
                any given time. It efficiently allocates CPU resources to active processes, ensuring optimal performance and 
                fair sharing of resources. Common scheduling algorithms include First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), 
                and Shortest Job Next (SJN).</p>
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => handleButtonClick('Disk Scheduling')} className="algorithm-button">
            <h1>Disk Scheduling</h1>
            <p>Disk scheduling manages how read and write requests to the disk are ordered, optimizing access time and overall
                 system performance. It determines the sequence in which disk I/O requests are processed, reducing seek time. 
                 Common algorithms include FCFS, Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF), and SCAN (Elevator Algorithm).</p>

        <button onClick={() => handleButtonClick('Deadlock Avoidance')} className="algorithm-button">
            <h1>Deadlock Avoidance</h1>
            <p>Deadlock avoidance ensures that a system never enters an unsafe state by carefully allocating resources. 
                The Bankerâ€™s algorithm is a classic example, where the system checks if resource allocation will keep the system 
                in a safe state before proceeding. This proactive approach helps in maintaining system stability and preventing
                 deadlocks.</p>
